        <h2>About JavaScript SPA</h2>
        <p>This is just a casual project to test what it would be like to create a Single Page Application without using any framework or library</p>
	<p>While there might be a better way to do this, this was just an abrupt and comical attempt at doing the unusual; as such, I had no intention of spending too much time on it.</p>
	<p>If this sparked any ideas in you, feel free to <a href='https://github.com/SageKyle/javascript-spa' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>check out the source code</a> and continue from where I stopped</p>
